2、介绍你的家乡

Introduce your hometown

我的家乡赣州是国家历史文化名城，有2200多年建城史，曾是宋代“三十六名城”之一，有江南宋城之称；是客家文化发源地之一，全球客家人主要聚居地，被誉为“客家摇篮”；同时是革命老区，中央苏区核心区域，中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府曾在此成立，故被称为红色故都。

My hometown, Ganzhou, is a national historical and cultural city with a history of more than 2,200 years. It was one of the "36 Famous Cities" in the Song Dynasty and is known as the Song City of Jiangnan. It is one of the birthplaces of Hakka culture and the main settlement area of Hakka people around the world. It is known as the "Cradle of Hakka"; it is also an old revolutionary base and the core area of the Central Soviet Area. The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic was established here, so it is called the Red Capital.
