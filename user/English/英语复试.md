### 自我介绍	

​	尊敬的各位老师，上午好。很高兴能拥有这次面试的机会。

​	我叫刘强，来自江西赣州，2023年毕业于九江学院，专业是地理信息科学。经过本科阶段的学习，已经能够熟练使用ArcGIS, ENVI等GIS软件，掌握多种计算机语言，如：C\C++, JAVA, C#, Python, JavaScript, Fortran等，同时也学习过机器学习和深度学习这方面的内容。

  我还拥有丰富的实践经历。2020年，在中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所生态中心王军邦老师课题组地理信息专业实习，期间熟练掌握 CEVSA 模型，并将模型从 Fortran 语言修改为 C 语言版本。2022年，参与本科老师的项目，与老师一起基于 Google Earth Engine 平台开发随机森林-形态特征算法。2024年，在中国科学院大气物理所碳中和研究中心韩鹏飞老师课题组负责配置与部署DayCent5模型。

  我擅长计算机和编程，自主学习的能力比较强，愿意接触新事物。希望各位老师能给我继续深造的机会，谢谢。





Good morning, respected professors. I am truly delighted to have this opportunity for an interview.

My name is Liu Qiang, and I hail from Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province. I graduated from Jiujiang University in 2023 with a major in Geographic Information Science. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have not only become proficient in using GIS software such as ArcGIS and ENVI, but also mastered a variety of programming languages, including C/C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, and Fortran. Additionally, I have delved into the realms of machine learning and deep learning.

My practical experience is also quite extensive. In 2020, I interned at the Ecological Center of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Professor Wang Junbang, where I specialized in geographic information. During this period, I became adept at the CEVSA model and successfully converted the model from Fortran to C. In 2022, I participated in a project led by my undergraduate advisor, where we developed a random forest-morphological feature algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine platform. In 2024, I was responsible for configuring and deploying the DayCent5 model at the Carbon Neutrality Research Center of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the tutelage of Professor Han Pengfei.

I am skilled in computing and programming, with a strong capacity for self-directed learning and a willingness to embrace new challenges. I sincerely hope that you will consider me for the opportunity to further my studies. Thank you.
